# Lucent

<!--*It's still magic even if you know how it's done. GNU Terry Pratchett*-->

[![Code coverage](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/github/greentfrapp/lucent.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/greentfrapp/lucent)

[Lucid](https://github.com/tensorflow/lucid) library adapted for PyTorch.

To quote Lucid:

**Lucent is research code, not production code. We provide no guarantee it will work for your use case.**

# Usage

In the spirit of Lucid, get up and running with Lucent immediately! The following notebooks
run right from your browser, thanks to [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). It's a Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup to use and runs entirely in the cloud.

You can run the notebooks on your local machine, too. Clone the repository and find them in the `notebooks` subfolder. You will need to run a local instance of the [Jupyter notebook environment](http://jupyter.org/install.html) to execute them.
